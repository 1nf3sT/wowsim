    Gear Quality Colors
    Gear Change data on hover of item change dropdown.
    Remove Gem button

Items
    Gear Quality

    More Gems - https://blizzardwatch.com/2021/04/07/burning-crusade-classic-gems/

Engine
    Set Bonuses (missing t5/6)

Other
    Implement Gear Phases
    seventyupgrades importer
    Add armor type to allow for a 'mail-only' optimization
    'Gear Sets' both pre-made and let players save the setup. (optionally allow for saving of buffs as well)
    History - Make another results tab that holds the history of all sims. (probably just Peak DPS + Avg DPS)
    Versioning - Add a version notification that can do a quick check to see if new version exists. (maybe include a like VERSION file the client can poll on every few minutes)
    Pull out advanced controls pane - 
        'Remove All Gear'
        'weights value modulation'
        'Gem Everything'
        '70Upgrades Import'
        'Phase Selector'
        'Hide Green/Blue Items'
    
    Look into more efficient serialization between sim <-> JS (use same serialization for wasm and server if that is ever implemented)
