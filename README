Other
    Implement Gear Phases
    seventyupgrades importer
    Add armor type to allow for a 'mail-only' optimization
    'Gear Sets' both pre-made and let players save the setup. (optionally allow for saving of buffs as well)
    History - Make another results tab that holds the history of all sims. (probably just Peak DPS + Avg DPS)
